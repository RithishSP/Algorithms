# [Coursera Algorithms Specialization by Stanford University](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)

## Coding Language
Python 3

## Course Review
* The course gives proofs of all the algorithms taught and offers insights on how to do the same for your algorithms, focusing on ideas such as reduction to solve complex problems.
* Assumes familiarity with a programming language and the ability to implement code from a high-level pseudocode or an algorithm outline.
* It covers all the fundamental ideas of algorithm design, including divide and conquer, randomized algorithms, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming and heuristics for complex problems.
* It covers most advanced data structures, including graphs, binary trees, heaps, hash-tables, and union-find.
